            <h2>Starting Today Microsoft Confirms Free Windows Update</h2>
            <img src="laki. copy 2.jpg" alt="Windows" width="600px" height="600px">
            <p>Republished on July 25 with analysis of Microsoft’s new0 update claims.

It’s now here. Microsoft’s controversial u-turn on Windows 10’s end of life has morphed into a free update offer, whereby the problem for 700 million users is postponed.

Windows 11 is the faster, better, safer option Microsoft wants the 700 million Windows 10 holdouts to move to. But says “we understand that moving to a new PC can take time, and we’re here to support you throughout the process.”

In a Tuesday blogpost, Microsoft says “starting today, individuals will begin to see an enrollment wizard through notifications and in Settings, making it simple to select the best option for you and enroll in ESU directly from your personal Windows 10 PC.”</p>

            <h2>AI Governance In Tax Technology:</h2>
            <img src="img12.jpg" alt="">
            <p>In this day and age of shifting regulation, the position of tax technology is no longer merely operational—instead, it's becoming more strategic. As GenAI integrates itself into fundamental business systems, leaders in tax are no longer merely dealing with automation but accountability.

For indirect tax departments—too often the behind-the-scenes guardians of confidential financial information—AI adoption guarantees faster compliance, cleaner audits and more intelligent document workflows. But here's the catch: The smarter our systems get, the more explainable, ethical and observable they have to be</p>

            <h2>Why Technology Alone can,t Fixe Healthcare</h2>
            <img src="ll.jpg" alt="">
            <p>According to the AMA, "healthcare spending in the U.S. increased by 7.5% in 2023 to $4.9 trillion," putting us well on track for healthcare to account for some 20% of the U.S. GDP by 2032. Meanwhile, about 25% of that spending is estimated to be the result of waste. From administrative complexity and billing errors to outright fraud and abuse, the entire healthcare payments cycle is rife with opportunities to fix broken workflows and decrease patient, provider and health insurer frustrations.

For the last decade or so, technology has been touted as the panacea to this problem. First, through predictive analytics and machine learning, and more recently through generative AI (GenAI) and agentic AI models that have promised to spot anomalies and red flags before erroneous claims are even paid, each technological evolution brings new promises to fix healthcare. Yet, wasteful healthcare spending just keeps rising. Where’s the disconnect?</p>
